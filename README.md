## My process

### Built with

- Mobile-first workflow
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- Get data from an API.
- React Router.
- Use icons in React.

### Continued development

I did this project a single CSS/Sass file because I thought there wouldn't be too much styling, but if I had to do it again I'd make a CSS/Sass file for each component.
